## 1. Introduction

Today, maintaining a healthy lifestyle has become an increasing challenge, especially for those facing demanding schedules, long hours in front of the computer, and constant academic pressure. This situation is particularly common among university students in technical fields like Computer Engineering, who often neglect their physical and emotional well-being due to lack of time, guidance, or practical alternatives.

HealthCode emerges as a response to this issue, aiming to facilitate the adoption of healthy habits without disrupting the university routine. The application focuses on two core pillars: access to healthy, quick, and easy-to-prepare snacks, and the incorporation of brief stretching exercises that can be performed anywhere and at any time during the day.

With personalized recommendations, automated suggestions, and a supportive community space, HealthCode seeks to naturally integrate into the daily lives of many students, helping them improve their well-being in a realistic, accessible, and sustainable way.

## 3. Strategy

In The Elements of User Experience, the first level in user-centered design is the strategy plane. This plane focuses on defining both the business objectives and the real needs of the users, establishing a solid foundation for product development.

In this context, we use the Value Proposition Canvas as a key tool for developing this stage. Through this framework, we identify what users expect to gain from our application, what frustrations they wish to avoid, and what tasks they are trying to accomplish in their daily lives. In this way, we align our solution with the usersâ€™ goals and motivations, ensuring that the experience offered fits their habits, time availability, and challenges within the university environment.
